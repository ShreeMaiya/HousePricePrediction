# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/House-Price-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd House-Price-Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

### Jupyter Notebook

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run all the cells to train the model and make predictions.

### Streamlit App

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the app.

## Usage

After running the notebook or the Streamlit app, you will be able to see the predicted house prices based on the input features. You can modify the input data to test the model with different values.
